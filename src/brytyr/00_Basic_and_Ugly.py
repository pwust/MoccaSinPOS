"""
The most basic Tkinter example.

There are a lot of ways around the web that show you how to init a basic Tkinter GUI. This combination of creating
the root Tkinter.Tk object from the main function and passing it into a class that sub-classes Tkinter.Frame is what
I have settled on personally. There are many ways to accomplish this for simple Tkinter GUIs.
